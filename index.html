<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Camron Shelton, I'm the CTO for a bank in Amarillo, Tx. My passions are hunting, fishing and camping. I have been working with computers since I was 6 years old. My first computer was an IBM 8086 and I wrote my first program in MS DOS 3.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>I ran my own company from 1997 till 2020 at which time I sold it to another company and began working for others again. Over the years I have worked at places like Georgia Pacfic and I have even done work for the FBI and with NASA.</p>

<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p>I hope that one day I will be able to begin investing a large amount of money into my new business, which we are building robotics in, and that we will be able to successfully complete our tasks, and won't have to really work again.</p>
